# Calculator Program
# Overview
This Java-based calculator program is built using Swing GUI, designed to perform both basic and advanced mathematical operations. The program includes a user-friendly interface with buttons for numerical input and various functions. It supports operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square roots, logarithms, factorials, and more.

In addition to the basic arithmetic, this program features memory functions (such as memory recall and memory operations) and provides error handling for common mathematical issues like division by zero.
